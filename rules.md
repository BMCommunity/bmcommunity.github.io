# Rules

Here are the rules that applies to the server. By joining the server, you automatically agree to these rules.

## General Rules

1. **Do not share private content.**  
Some creators in this community wish to keep their creations private. We respect those wishes by not allowing others to share it without the author's permission.

2. **Do not steal content.**  
Because this is a community server, many people here are content creators. If any content is stolen, the staff might take an action.

3. **Respect other rules from creators.**  
For example, if an author says "don't modify my MIDI," then you aren't allowed to modify their MIDI without their specific permission.

4. **No begging.**  
Repeatedly asking for something, including getting private content or getting a roles in this server, might result in punishment.

## Other Rules

1. **No spamming.**  
#spam-and-bots is the only place where you can spam. We have Dyno auto-mod here, but it's not perfect. If users think what you're doing counts as spamming, then you might get muted.

2. **Respect other users.**  
Although freedom of speech is important, there comes a point where everyone else thinks you're a dickhead for saying something. Repeatedly doing so will cause you to get muted or in extreme cases, banned. Repeated harassment is not tolerated, including harassment in DMs.

3. **No NSFW/NSFL.**  
Pornography, nudity, animal abuse, very graphic imagery, and other similar content is not tolerated here. Punishment depends on the severity of the content.

4. **Don't act stupid.**  
If the vast majority of active users agree that you're disruptive or annoying, an action might be taken.
